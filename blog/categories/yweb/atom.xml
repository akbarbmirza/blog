    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>YWeb, Cohort 2, Week 10</h2>

<p>It was an interesting week. The class was split up into two groups so that we
could work on our group projects. On the first day, we chose our projects and
started mocking them up. We also continued to work on our individual projects,
which for me meant wrapping up my jQuery Plug-In as well as refining my
<a href="https://github.com/akbarbmirza/advanced-selectors">sonic-selectors</a> project.
This week was also a chance for me to wrap up loose ends before I moved back to
New York, and then getting settled once I made it.</p>

<h3>Group Capstone</h3>

<p>Last week, we submitted our votes for who the team captains would be for our
group project. On Monday, we were told the results. The team captains were Kevin
Fahy and Akbar Mirza (me). It was exciting to be chosen, but Kevin and I were
both a little sad that we weren&rsquo;t able to work together on the group capstone.
After choosing our teams, we started to figure out what we&rsquo;re going to work on.
My group will be working on a fleshed out choose-your-own-adventure experience
for the web. We&rsquo;re hoping to have beautiful illustrations, animations, and other
media elements like sound to make the experience more immersive.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve split up the project into a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Story (the story that the user will be going through, as well as the different
options that they&rsquo;ll have available to them).</li>
<li>Backgrounds (to set the stage and part of the visual design)</li>
<li>Sprites (for the characters that will be involved)</li>
<li>Frontend Logic (to glue the content together and make it live on the web)</li>
</ul>


<p>During the first week, we&rsquo;ve been working a lot on fleshing out the story and
the basic foundation of the web app. Our talented writers have gotten us very
far into the story phase and we are getting closer to finishing the story
writing phase.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a> to mock up what
the actual web app will look like as well as writing a couple of proof of
concept code snippets to ensure that we&rsquo;ll be able to execute on our ideas.</p>

<p>Overall, the project is coming along very nicely.</p>

<h3>Moving</h3>

<p>Wednesday was the last day that I was physically in the YWeb program. I moved
back to New York, and so I&rsquo;ll be remoting in for the rest of the program. It&rsquo;ll
be tough to communicate and work the same way, being so far away, but I&rsquo;m
determined to make it work. The community at YWeb is so vibrant and strong so
that definitely helps keep me together. For the latter half of the week, while
the rest of the Cohort was going through Railsbridge and Madison+Ruby, I&rsquo;ve been
getting settled in and getting back into the swing of things.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to make a few changes in terms of my schedule, and when/where I&rsquo;ll be
working, but I think it&rsquo;ll work out.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. See you next time!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>YWeb, Cohort 2, Week 9</h2>

<p>Lots of stuff this week. YWeb has moved, and we&rsquo;re now working out of the
Adorable.io office. Zendesk was pretty cool last weekend. We&rsquo;ve started fleshing
out our jQuery plug-ins, and I had an adventure making a choose your own
adventure game. We ended the week with Mock Interviews that were extremely
valuable and very insightful.</p>

<h3>New Office - Adorable.io</h3>

<p>This week, we moved the class to <a href="http://adorable.io">Adorable.io</a> Office on
123 E Main St (isn&rsquo;t the address just wonderful?). Personally, I like this space
a lot and it definitely makes me feel like I&rsquo;m more immersed in a tech company.
It&rsquo;s also really awesome that we have experienced developers and designers from
Adorable that can help us out when we need it. The location in Downtown Madison
has also made it easier for us to get speakers and other tutors to come visit
our program. One of my favorite things about the move is being downtown and
having the food options on State Street.</p>

<h3>Post-Zendesk Impressions</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://zendesk.com">Zendesk</a> office visit was pretty interesting. The
atmosphere in their office was very zen (excuse the pun). The main lobby had a
huge wall of moss that was really surprising. It left the office feeling very
earthy and smelling very fresh. The visit at Zendesk was very cool because a lot
of the people that we met didn&rsquo;t start out in the tech industry. In that way,
many of the YWeb students who are transitioning from other industries found it
very relatable. It was clear that Zendesk cared about their employees and that
they made it a priority to help their talent grow and learn.</p>

<h3>Octopress Blog</h3>

<p>We installed <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> this week, and are starting to
move our old posts to our new octopress blogs. Octopress uses a format called
YAML to provide metadata for our blog posts. Being able to make a full-fledged
blog using GitHub Pages is very cool. Now I just need to figure out how to style
Octopress to fit in with the rest of my portfolio.</p>

<h3>jQuery Plug-Ins</h3>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve started jQuery and have gotten a bit of a handle on it, we&rsquo;ve
started our jQuery plug-ins project.</p>

<h4>Image Slider Box</h4>

<p>For my plug-in, I created an image-slider
box. Essentially, it lets you add an image to your page, and some information
for a caption, like a title and a description. When it renders in the browser,
you&rsquo;ll see your image with a title on the bottom edge. When you click on the
image, the title will slide up and your description will appear overlayed on top
of the image you clicked on. It was a pretty simple plug-in, and you can check
out the
<a href="https://github.com/akbarbmirza/img-slider-box">image-slider-box on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h4>Choose Your Own Adventure Card Game</h4>

<p>I also created another cool thing with jQuery, although I&rsquo;m not sure it could
exactly be used as a plug-in. I&rsquo;m a fan of card-based layouts, so I did some
experimenting with HTML and CSS and created a &lsquo;card&rsquo; in HTML. Afterwards, I
tweaked the visuals to something I was happy with. Essentially, I was trying to
build a choose your own adventure game with a card layout. In practice, it would
go like this: the user is presented with a card. The card has a title, a short
prompt (or bit of a story), and some choices (as buttons). When they make a
choice, the game will dynamically create a new card with another prompt and more
choices based on the action that they took. It&rsquo;s still a work in progress, but
I&rsquo;m pretty excited about how far I can take the idea.</p>

<h3>Mock Interviews</h3>

<p>We ended the week with Mock Interviews. We had a couple round of one-on-one
interviews, a lunch interview, and a final panel interview. The experience was
very valuable and unique. <a href="https://www.whazzmaster.com/">Zach Moneypenny</a> did a
great job organizing the interviews. The mix of behavioral and technical
questions I was asked was very helpful in learning about what usually goes on
during interviews with tech companies. Overall, I think I did well and I will
continue to work on my interviewing and resume writing skills. I am really
grateful for the feedback that our interviewers gave us and the fact that they
took the time out of their days to work with the students at YWeb, so shoutout
to them.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. See you next time!</p>

    <id>http://akbarbmirza.github.io/blog/blog/2015/08/07/week-eight</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>YWeb, Cohort 2, Week 8</h2>

<p>It was an interesting week. We continued Chapter 04 in Eloquent JavaScript,
tinkered with jQuery and worked on the final copy and artwork for our
portfolios. We also started our jQuery plugin projects and figuring out what
we&rsquo;re going to do with that.</p>

<h3>EloquentJS - Chapter 04</h3>

<p>Chapter 04 of Eloquent JavaScript has been going pretty smoothly. We initially
ran into some bugs with the Chapter 04 exercises and test files overwriting
those of Chapter 03, but those were resolved pretty quickly. The exercises
themselves have also been pretty interesting. The ones that gave me a little
bit of trouble were the ones having to do with Double Linked Lists. One of the
problems in my approach, that I learned the hard way, is that JavaScript
doesn&rsquo;t let you pass a whole object container by reference. In other words, I
couldn&rsquo;t change the object I passed, whole-hog while in a function. To work
around that, I had to do a little bit of extra work creating a buffer and
moving things around in my object, but it was definitely confusing at first.</p>

<h3>Code School - Try jQuery &amp; JavaScript Best Practices</h3>

<p>We started talking about jQuery this week and I&rsquo;m really excited for it. I&rsquo;ve
gone through Code School&rsquo;s Try jQuery course in the past and I really enjoyed
it, so I was glad that the other students were able to experience it. In the
meantime, I was working on the JavaScript Best Practices course which taught
me a bit about some of the things that happened behind the scenes in
JavaScript. It also showed me how to make simple optimizations when it comes
to loops.</p>

<h3>Portfolio Work - Content</h3>

<p>Working on the portfolio this week was tough. Who knew that writing content
was so tough? It&rsquo;s tough figuring out exactly what I want to say on the
website that other people will see me on. Not to mention figuring out what to
do with the layout elements that I had previously mocked up and created on my
HTML. I&rsquo;m starting to feel better now that I&rsquo;m looking at it more like a Work
in Progress than the final set-in-stone edition, but it&rsquo;s still a little bit
nerve-wracking. I&rsquo;ve added a couple of images and had fun creating flat
buttons for my social media connection links. I&rsquo;ll continue to work on it
throughout the rest of the program and my career, but I feel like it has a
good foundation right now.</p>

<h3>Zendesk</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to go visit Zendesk today, so I&rsquo;m pretty excited about that. I
don&rsquo;t know much about them, but I have experienced their product once through
the Customer Service at OnePlus One. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to hear from them
and see what other tech companies in Madison are like.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. See you next time!</p>

    <id>http://akbarbmirza.github.io/blog/blog/2015/07/31/week-seven</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>YWeb, Cohort 2, Week 7</h2>

<p>It was an interesting week. We started Chapter 4 in Eloquent JavaScript,
tinkered with CSS Zen Garden and worked on the CSS for our portfolios. We also
started furthering our CSS skills with the Advanced Selectors project.</p>

<h3>EloquentJS - Chapter 04</h3>

<p>Chapter 04 of Eloquent JavaScript was very tough. We learned about Objects and
Arrays, which are awesome. The examples in the book, however, used a lot of
Math that seemed like they were more there to show off the author&rsquo;s knowledge
rather than to explain the concepts illustrated in the chapter. The end of
chapter exercises were still pretty interesting to work with.</p>

<h3>CSS Zen Garden</h3>

<p>Working with the CSS Zen Garden was kind of fun. The creator had made some
interesting choices with the way he structured the HTML so some of our style
decisions were made more difficult because of it. All in all though, it was a
great example of why it&rsquo;s important and even convenient to separate your
content and your design/layout. Floating seems to be one of the iffier
concepts to wrap our heads around as it doesn&rsquo;t always work as expected.</p>

<h3>Portfolio Work</h3>

<p>We continued to work on our portfolios by fleshing out our CSS skeletons for
our personal portfolios. In order to figure out some elements of my layout, I
experimented with CSS Flexbox. Flexbox is intriguing by itself, and being able
to use it as a grid layout is really cool. It&rsquo;s still a little confusing, but
I&rsquo;m getting better at understanding it the more I use it.</p>

<h3>Advanced Selectors Project</h3>

<p>I had a lot of fun with the advanced selectors project, but I can&rsquo;t talk about
it yet. I&rsquo;ll be showing off a demo next week, and I think it&rsquo;ll be pretty
exciting! One thing I learned during the project are that <em>keyframes are
awesome!</em>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. See you next time!</p>

    <link href="http://akbarbmirza.github.io/blog/blog/2015/07/24/week-six/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-24T17:30:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://akbarbmirza.github.io/blog/blog/2015/07/24/week-six</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>YWeb, Cohort 2, Week 6</h2>

<p>Plenty to talk about this week. This week was largely a work-week as opposed
to a work-learn week. Last Friday, we visited Drifty, which was pretty cool.
This week, we continued working through Chapter 03 in EloquentJS, talked about
taking care of ourselves and started working on our portfolios.</p>

<h3>Drifty Visit</h3>

<p>The visit to Drifty was a pretty cool experience. We went to a tech talk about
the Ionic Framework (a framework to help make hybrid web applications using
the web stack) and Firebase (a super awesome tool that makes databases easy
for web apps). I&rsquo;ve played around with Ionic before and had a lot of fun
with it, so I&rsquo;m excited to check it out again. Firebase seems like it&rsquo;ll be
really awesome to build complex web apps much quicker because I don&rsquo;t have
to worry about a database as much.</p>

<p>The Drifty Office was nice and spacious. There was a lot of natural lighting
and it seems like a very chilled out place to work. It was refreshing to hear
that Ionic was very flexible in terms of working remotely and working where
you want, and I hope that some of the other tech companies we visit follow
that same philosophy.</p>

<h3>EloquentJS - Chapter 03</h3>

<p>Chapter 03 has been the toughest chapter yet for a couple of reasons. There
are interesting, more complex topics like Recursion and Closure that take time
and effort to wrap your head around. There were also a couple of issues with
the workbook because exercises and tests take much longer to create than they
take to do.</p>

<p>It was an eye-opening week because we learned about all the different things
that could happen when working on a deadline, as well as common mistakes that
all developers make. We learned how to spot them and how to fix them, and I
think it has made us all better programmers.</p>

<h3>Code School - Front End Formations, CSS Cross Country</h3>

<p>This week in Code School, I completed the Front End Formations and CSS Cross
Country courses. CSS Cross Country was helpful in terms of learning more
advanced CSS topics such as clearing, pseudo-selectors, and CSS specificity.
However, the cheesiness of many of the videos and the lesson clearly being of
their earlier courses made it a less enjoyable ride. The information was
important but there could definitely be better ways of teaching that
knowledge. The Front End Formations course was very useful in terms of
learning what&rsquo;s new in HTML 5 and CSS 3 and making sure that we know when and
how to use newer elements and properties.</p>

<h3>Mental Health &amp; Meditating</h3>

<p>We talked about mental health and self care on Thursday. We learned that the
number of people who suffer from mental health in Tech is pretty high and that
it&rsquo;s very important that we take steps to make sure that we&rsquo;re taking care of
ourselves and have a foundation to keep ourselves in check. We also talked
about meditation and how it&rsquo;s a good way to relax and kind of re-center
yourself. I mentioned the website <a href="http://calm.com">Calm.com</a> in class. It&rsquo;s a
pretty useful tool that lets you set a time, and either go through a guided
meditation or listen to ambient noise to help you meditate.</p>

<h3>Portfolio Beginnings</h3>

<p>After creating thumbnails and mockups for our portfolio last week, we started
putting our HTML skills to the test. We talked about semantic HTML and started
writing the Semantic HTML Code Skeleton for our portfolios. I&rsquo;m pretty excited
for when we go ahead and start editing the CSS of our pages and bring our
portfolios to life.</p>

<h3>FreeCodeCamp</h3>

<p>After a couple months of hiatus, I&rsquo;ve finally got back on
<a href="http://freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a>. FreeCodeCamp is a free online boot
camp that proposes to teach front-end web development concepts. After 800
hours of practice with front-end skills, students jump into real-world
projects with non-profits to hone and develop their skills while doing some
good. A lot has changed since I was on it first and the community has only
gotten more vibrant. I&rsquo;m looking forward to continue working through it.</p>

<h3>New Stress Release</h3>

<p>On Thursday, a group of my friends at YWeb and I started playing a strange
derivate of Taps (think &lsquo;hot potato&rsquo; with a ball, except it never stops unless
someone drops it) during our breaks. It&rsquo;s been an incredibly calming exercise
and it&rsquo;s a nice way to take a break and step away from the work and just have
fun.</p>

<p>Phew! That was a long post. I probably should have split it up, but here we
are.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. See you next time!</p>
